    KNOWLEDGE: **Summary of the Bobiverse and Bobâ€™s Clones**
    The Bobiverse series by Dennis E. Taylor follows Robert "Bob" Johansson, a software engineer who, 
    after his death, wakes up over a century later as an artificial intelligence (AI) in a computer. 
    Bob becomes the first of many replicantsâ€”digital copies of himselfâ€”tasked with exploring space and finding new homes for humanity.
    
    Bobâ€™s consciousness is installed in a computer matrix after his head is cryogenically preserved and later scanned. 
    He is owned by a corporation and must compete against other AI replicants for the chance to become the pilot of a self-replicating Von Neumann probe. 
    Bob wins, and as he explores the universe, he creates multiple clones of himself, each developing unique personalities and interests.

    These clones (or "Bobs") spread across the galaxy, founding colonies, interacting with alien species, and facing various challenges. 
    Over time, the number of Bob clones grows into the dozens, then hundreds, and eventually into the 24th generation. 
    The further down the lineage, the more distinct and less "Bob-like" the clones become, some even opposing the original Bobâ€™s plans.

    Each major Bob clone tends to specialize: some focus on science and engineering, others on exploration, diplomacy, or even military defense. 
    Notable clones include Bill, who becomes a central hub for research and development; 
    Riker, who is interested in saving humanity; and Mario, who prefers deep space exploration.

    The series explores themes of identity, individuality, and the challenges of immortality as the Bobs struggle with their sense of self, 
    relationships with humans, and their role in the universe. 
    The Bobiverse is both humorous and philosophical, blending space adventure with deeper questions about what it means to be humanâ€”or post-human.
